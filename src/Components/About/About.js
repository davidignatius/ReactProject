                Instagram (also known informally as IG or Insta[11]) is an American photo and video-sharing social networking service owned by Facebook, Inc. It was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and launched in October 2010 exclusively on iOS. A version for Android devices was released a year and half later in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited website interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app on June 15, 2014 and an app for Windows 10 tablets and computers in October 2016. The app allows users to upload photos and videos to the service, which can be edited with various filters, and organized with tags and location information. An account's posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a feed.

The service was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect ratio with 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. These restrictions were later eased in 2015, with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, as well as "Stories"—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is being used by 500 million users daily.[12]

After its launch in 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion as of May 2019.

<h3>In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded to the service. Although praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for policy and interface changes, allegations of censorship, and illegal or improper content uploaded by users.

As of January 2020, the most-followed person is footballer Cristiano Ronaldo with over 200 million followers, and the most-followed woman is singer Ariana Grande with over 173 million followers.

As of January 14, 2019, the most liked photo on Instagram is a picture of an egg, posted by the account @world_record_egg, created with the sole purpose of surpassing the previous record of 18 million likes on a Kylie Jenner post. The picture currently has over 53 million likes.[13] Instagram was announced to be the 4th most downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.[14]

            History
Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.[15] Realizing that Burbn was to similar to Foursquare, Systrom and Krieger refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among Burbn users.[16] They renamed the app Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.[17]

2010: Beginnings
On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[18] Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[19] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[19] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[19][20]

The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger on July 16, 2010.[21][22]

Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later (at 9:24 PM). It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.[23][24][better source needed]

On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store.[25]
</h3><h3><br/>
2011: Major funding
In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[26] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.[27] In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million valuation.[28] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[29]

2012: Android release, Facebook acquisition and web launch
On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[30][31] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[32]

On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock,[33][34][35] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[36][37][38] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[39] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[40] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[41][42]

The deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN. 
</h3><h3><br/>[38] The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[38] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was "committed to building and growing Instagram independently." [38] According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.[43]

In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality. [44]

2014: Android update and Facebook Places
The Android app has received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[45][46] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users are located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were "exploring an iOS version".[47][48][49]

Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.[50][51]
